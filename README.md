# bot
discord

for my discord bots which you can add with
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=441406080627769364&permissions=8&scope=bot
the code will allow you to attach it to another bot user
also the id.id file isnt included due to me not wanting the bot user suspended
but you can make it and type in the bot user token
